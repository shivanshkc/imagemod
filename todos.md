# Todo List - Image Generation Project

## Priority Order (High to Low)

1. **Move hardcoded API key to environment variable** (critical security vulnerability)
2. **Replace panic() calls with proper error handling** and graceful failures
3. **Add input validation** for file existence and image format
4. **Add API response validation** to ensure safe content processing
5. **Make input/output file paths configurable** via command line arguments or config
6. **Improve file permissions security** (currently 0644 allows others to read)
7. **Add proper logging** instead of direct fmt.Println
8. **Add code documentation and comments** for maintainability
9. **Add configuration file support** for better flexibility
10. **Consider adding unit tests** for core functionality

## Notes
- Security issues (items 1-2) should be addressed immediately
- Validation improvements (items 3-4) are critical for production readiness
- Configuration and usability improvements (items 5-9) enhance maintainability
- Testing (item 10) supports long-term code quality
